# Personal-Expense-Tracker
I have built a simple and user-friendly Personal Expense Tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete their daily expenses, and also provides a summary with a category-wise pie chart.
All data is saved in the browser using localStorage, and the design is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile.
